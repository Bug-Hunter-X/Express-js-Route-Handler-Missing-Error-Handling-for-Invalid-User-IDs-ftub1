# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User IDs

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  missing error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the route `/users/:id` attempts to fetch a user based on the ID provided in the URL parameters. However, it lacks proper error handling for scenarios where the `id` is not a valid integer or is missing, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Bug Description
The route handler attempts to parse the `userId` as an integer using `parseInt()`. If `req.params.id` is not a valid integer (e.g., it's a string like 'abc'), `parseInt()` will return `NaN`, causing the `.find()` method to fail silently or throw an error, depending on the underlying data structure.  Furthermore, if the `id` parameter is missing entirely, the code will also fail.

## Solution
The solution adds comprehensive error handling to address these scenarios. It checks if `req.params.id` is defined, if it's a valid integer, and if a user with that ID exists.  If any of these conditions are not met, appropriate HTTP error responses (400 Bad Request or 404 Not Found) are returned.
